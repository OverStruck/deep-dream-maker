## Quickstart
**NOTE:** The only requirement is to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system!

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/OverStruck/deep-dream-maker.git`

Build the images: `docker-compose build`

Build run the services:
`docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` if you don't want to see the terminal output

Alternativetely you can also build the images and run them at the same time:
`docker-compose up --build`

After the containers are running and fully initialized, you can go to `http://localhost:7777/` in your favorite web broswer and start making deep dream images! ðŸ˜Š

## Current state of the project
DeepDream maker has been updated from version 1 to version 2. This new version uses Docker & Docker Compose to allow for a seamless experience.

Happy dreaming!
