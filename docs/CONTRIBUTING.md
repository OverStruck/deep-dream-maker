# Contributing to DeepDream Maker

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Discussing the current state of the code

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same GNU General Public License v3.0 that covers the project.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce

### Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
